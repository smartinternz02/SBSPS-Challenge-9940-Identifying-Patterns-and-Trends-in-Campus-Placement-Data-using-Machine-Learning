# Identifying Patterns and Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine learning
----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Data
We used the given dataset from Kaggle. You can find it here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement)
## Requirements
You should have installed python, Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
## Model Deployment
Model deployment is done with the help of IBM Watson Studio and IBM Watson Machine Learning. We created an API, so that we can predict the outpuut for the given input values from the form.
## Run the application
1. Download the zip file of this repository and unzip it.
2. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder
3. Run the command `flask run`
